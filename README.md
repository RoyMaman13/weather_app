# Weather Web Application

Welcome to the Weather Web Application! This project includes both client and server repositories for retrieving real-time weather data.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RoyMaman13/weather_app.git
cd weather_app
```bash

Install Dependencies
To ensure the React frontend works properly, navigate to the client directory and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm install
Run the Application
To start both the client and server simultaneously, make sure you are in the weather_app directory and run:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Note: Ensure you have the concurrently library installed to run both applications at the same time.

Running Separately
Alternatively, you can run the client and server separately by navigating to their respective directories and executing:

bash
Copy code
# For the client
cd client
npm start

# For the server
cd server
npm start
