# Weather Web Application

Welcome to the Weather Web Application! This project includes both client and server repositories for retrieving real-time weather data.



Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RoyMaman13/weather_app.git
cd weather_app
```

### Install Dependencies
To ensure the React frontend works properly, navigate to the client directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

### Run the Application
There are two ways to run the application:

1] To start both the client and server simultaneously, make sure you are in the weather_app directory and run:

```bash
npm start
```
Note: Ensure you have the concurrently library installed to run both applications at the same time.

2] Alternatively, you can run the client and server separately by navigating to their respective directories and executing:

### For the client

```bash
cd client
npm start
```

### For the server
```bash
cd server
npm start
```
